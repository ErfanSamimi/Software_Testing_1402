# Mutation Testing Automation Tool

## Description

This project was developed as part of a University Academic Project. It implements an automated solution for Mutation Testing, including generating code mutants, applying mutations, compiling and testing mutated code, and calculating the Mutation Score. The tool supports mutation of operators, loop controls, boolean values, and numeric literals in source code, and automates the evaluation of test suite effectiveness.

## Key Learning Outcomes

- Implementation of Mutation Testing methodology
- Automated code mutation and mutant management
- Mutation Score calculation and evaluation
- Use of Python for source code analysis and manipulation
- Integration of compilation and test execution in workflow
- Application of software testing principles in practice

**Summary:** This project enabled practical experience in automated mutation testing, code analysis, and quantitative evaluation of test suite effectiveness.
